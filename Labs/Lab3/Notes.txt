Bug 1:

Reason for crash: Performing the >=0 operation, which is always true for size_t data types, which is a type of unsigned integer.

fix: Changed >=0 to >0

Reason for error: v[i] should be changed to v[i-1] during the printing of the output, since v[i] points to a random location in memory while v[i-1] points to the correct index of the vector.

Bug 2:

Reason for crash: Original definition: bool operator == (Fraction a, Fraction b) was: return a == b;. Line changed to:


  	if ((a.n == b.n) && (a.d == b.d)) 
		return true;
	else
  		return false;	

Reason for error: Output was originally 1. Included line:

std::cout.setf(std::ios::boolalpha);

which converts the 1 or 0 to a true or false value when displayed.

Bug 3:

Reason for error: 1)Extra { added at the bottom of main function

fix: remove the redundant {

Reason for error: 2) No return type in function int get_number(std::istream &is). 

fix: add line: return result; at the end of get_number function.

Possible error: int tot is not initialized to 0. 

fix: initialize tot with line: int tot = 0;
